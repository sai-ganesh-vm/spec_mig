# Athena and Glue <br>
Equivalent of AWS Athena in GCP is BigQuery<br>
### BIGQUERY:
A fully managed data warehouse for running serverless SQL queries on structured and semi-structured data.<br>
it is same as athena but there are some syntax differences<br>
<br>
Equivalent of aws Glue in GCP is a combination of Cloud Dataflow, Cloud Data Fusion, and Google Cloud Storage (GCS) <br>
### Cloud Dataflow:
A fully managed service for real-time and batch data processing using Apache Beam. It will handle ETL pipelines.<br>
### Cloud Data Fusion: 
Visual ETL tool for building and managing data integration pipelines (replaces Glue Studio).<br>
### Google Data Catalog:
Stores metadata about datasets in GCP, similar to AWS Glue Data Catalog.<br>

### steps to follow <br>
<b> Data Migration</b>: Move data from Amazon S3 to Google Cloud Storage (GCS).<br>
<b> Query Migration</b>: Migrate SQL queries from AWS Athena to Google BigQuery.<br>
<b> ETL Pipeline Migration</b>: Migrate AWS Glue ETL jobs to Cloud Dataflow and Cloud Data Fusion.<br>
<b> Metadata Migration</b>: Migrate AWS Glue Data Catalog metadata to Google Data Catalog.<br>
## 1.data migration from aws s3 to GCS :<br>
List all data files in Amazon S3 that are being used by Athena adn Glue and identify which format they are being stored <br>
now create gcs bucket in google cloud platform .<br>
Use `gsutil` to copy data from S3 to GCS. by using gsutil you can transfer data of s3 to gcs<br>
```
gsutil -m cp -r s3://<s3-bucket-path>/* gs://<gcs-bucket-path>/
```
After the migration, verify that all files have been copied correctly and check file permissions in GCS.<br>
## 2.Migrating AWS Athena Queries to Google BigQuery:<br>
<b>Goal:</b> Migrate your SQL queries from AWS Athena to Google BigQuery, which is GCP's fully managed analytics data warehouse.<br>
<br>
identify and document all the query in athena,tables,databases,and data sources involved<br>
Create BigQuery datasets that mirror the structure of the data in S3<br>
create a bigquery tables using schema of the data stored in GCS. You can manually define tables or use schema inference from GCS files.<br>
Athena and BigQuery use SQL, but there are some differences in syntax and functions. Review and adjust queries as needed<br>
<br>
<b>3.Migrating AWS Glue ETL Pipelines:</b><br>
<br>
Identify Glue ETL jobs, including the source (S3), transformations, and target destinations.<br>
Rewrite the ETL logic using Apache Beam, which is supported by Cloud Dataflow.<br>
<br>
<b> example beam pipeline </b>
```
import apache_beam as beam

def process(row):
    # Transform logic here
    return row

p = beam.Pipeline()

(p
  | 'Read from GCS' >> beam.io.ReadFromText('gs://my-data-bucket/input.csv')
  | 'Transform Data' >> beam.Map(process)
  | 'Write to GCS' >> beam.io.WriteToText('gs://my-data-bucket/output.csv'))

p.run()
```
